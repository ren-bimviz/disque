         *
         * 2) AOF is ENABLED and the rewritten AOF will immediately start
         * receiving writes. After the temporary file is renamed to the
         * configured file, the original AOF file descriptor will be closed.
         * Since this will be the last reference to that file, closing it
         * causes the underlying file to be unlinked, which may block the
         * server.

         * caused by rename(2) in scenario 1, or by close(2) in scenario 2), we
         * use a background thread to take care of this. First, we
         * make scenario 1 identical to scenario 2 by opening the target file
         * when it exists. The unlink operation after the rename(2) will then
         * be executed upon calling close(2) for its descriptor. Everything to
         * guarantee atomicity for this switch has already happened by then, so
